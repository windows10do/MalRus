# Contributing to MalRus

We welcome contributions to improve MalRus!  
This document outlines the process and best practices for contributing.

---

## Getting Started

> [!TIP]
>
> Fork the repository before making changes. This keeps your work isolated until it’s ready to merge.

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.  
2. Clone your fork locally:  
   `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/MalRus.git`  
   `cd MalRus`  
3. Create a new branch for your changes:  
   `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`

---

## Making Changes

> [!NOTE]
>
> Keep changes focused. Small, well‑scoped pull requests are easier to review and merge.

- Follow the existing coding style (Bash scripting conventions).  
- Update documentation (`README.md`, `SECURITY.md`) if your changes affect usage or security.  
- Test your changes in Termux before submitting.

---

## Commit Guidelines

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Write clear, descriptive commit messages. They should explain *what* changed and *why*.

Examples:  
- `Add contacts scan feature`  
- `Fix logging bug in quarantine system`  
- `Update README with installation steps`

---

## Pull Requests

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Do not submit pull requests directly to the `master` branch without review.

- Push your branch to your fork:  
  `git push origin feature/my-new-feature`  
- Open a pull request against the `master` branch of `windows10do/MalRus`.  
- Provide a description of your changes, including motivation and testing steps.
